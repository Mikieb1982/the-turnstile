# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application with a turnstile component. The goal is to integrate Firebase for backend services.

## Existing Features

* Next.js application with App Router.
* A `useLocalStorage` hook for client-side storage.

2.  **Visually Appealing Design:** The landing page will be visually appealing and informative, based on the provided text about "The Core Value: Your Digital Companion".
3.  **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the modern and bold design principles.
4.  **Header:** Create a visually distinct header with the application name "The Turnstile".
5.  **Sections:** Structure the page with clear sections for each of the key features: "Tracking Your Match History", "The Personalized Dashboard and Statistics", "Gamification and Social Sharing", and "The User Support Experience".
6.  **Visual Elements:** Use icons and other visual elements to make the page more engaging.
7.  **Responsive Design:** Ensure the page is responsive and works well on both mobile and web.
8.  **Rugby League Specific:** Update the landing page to be specifically for the Rugby League Super League.
